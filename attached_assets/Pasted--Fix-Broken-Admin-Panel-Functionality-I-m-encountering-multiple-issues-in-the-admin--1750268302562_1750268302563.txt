> 🛠️ **Fix Broken Admin Panel Functionality**
>
> I'm encountering multiple issues in the **admin panel**, and since you’ve built this project, you should already know the structure and logic. Please fix the following problems thoroughly:
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔶 Promo Code Management (inside the "Promo Code" tab of the admin panel)
>
> * Creating a new promo code throws an error and doesn’t save.
> * Updating existing promo codes also fails.
> * Nothing is reflected in the database or UI.
>
> You should:
>
> * Check the form submission logic and API handler.
> * Make sure the backend route for promo code creation and update is working.
> * Ensure validation isn’t blocking valid inputs.
> * Verify the response is handled correctly in the frontend.
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔶 System Settings — Tax Rate & Service Fee (inside the "System Settings" tab)
>
> * Trying to update tax rate or service fee fails with visible error messages.
> * Changes are not applied or reflected in the database.
>
> You should:
>
> * Debug the update logic for these settings.
> * Check the API route and handler for saving settings.
> * Ensure correct value types are sent and expected (number/string).
> * Confirm there are no schema or database constraint issues.
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔁 General Reminders
>
> * You're the original creator, so please **trace the full flow** from UI → API → DB and back.
> * Log responses and check for silent errors.
> * Don’t forget to **invalidate or refetch relevant queries** after successful updates.
> * Make sure settings and promo code values are loaded dynamically after any change.
> * If authentication is required for these requests, make sure admin tokens/cookies are present.
>
> ---
>
> ✅ **Expected Outcome**
>
> * Promo code creation and update should work smoothly.
> * Tax rate and service fee should update and persist correctly.
> * All changes should reflect live in the UI and database without needing manual refresh.
>
> Fix everything so that it works as intended for production deployment. Let me know once it’s complete.
