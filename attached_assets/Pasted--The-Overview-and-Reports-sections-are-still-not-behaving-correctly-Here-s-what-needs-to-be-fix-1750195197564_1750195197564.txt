The Overview and Reports sections are still not behaving correctly. Here's what needs to be fixed:

---

### ✅ Overview Tab — Show Only Today's Data

1. **Today's Orders & Revenue Only**

   * Show only **today’s orders** and **today’s revenue from completed orders**.
   * Currently it's mixing in older data — this needs to be filtered by today’s date (Cork timezone).

2. **Recent Orders Section**

   * Show **only today’s orders**, sorted by **latest status update time** (e.g. when moved to "completed").
   * Don’t display all statuses or timestamps — show just the **latest status and its update time**.

3. **Clean UI**

   * Remove or move unrelated metrics like “Average Order” and “Last Updated” to the Reports section — the Overview tab should show **only today’s snapshot**.

### 📊 View Reports Page — Fix the Following:

1. **New Orders Not Reflected**

   * Recent new orders (including the ones just added) are **not appearing** in the reports.
   * Reports page must update to include:

     * Orders from today
     * Any newly created orders (real or test)
     * Revenue calculations based on completed orders

2. **30 Test Orders Missing**

   * You added 30 test orders spread across 2 months — but they **do not appear** in any report or chart.
   * Reports must accurately reflect:

     * **Daily revenue (last 30 days)**
     * **Monthly revenue (last 12 months)**
     * And show **all orders and revenue from the test data** where applicable.

3. **Charts Must Reflect Real Data**

   * Daily and monthly revenue charts must pull from actual stored order records (with correct timestamps and statuses).

Make sure the Reports section is pulling from the same source as the Overview tab but for the last 30 days.

### ✅ Final Checklist

* [ ] Overview tab shows only today’s orders, revenue, and recent activity
* [ ] “Recent Orders” only includes today’s orders, sorted by last status time
* [ ] View Reports shows newly added orders (real-time or on refresh)
* [ ] 30 test orders are reflected accurately in charts and totals
* [ ] Unrelated stats removed from Overview, if not tied to today
