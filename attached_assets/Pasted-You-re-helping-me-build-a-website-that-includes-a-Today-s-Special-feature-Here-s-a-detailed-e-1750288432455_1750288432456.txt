You're helping me build a website that includes a **"Today's Special"** feature. Here's a detailed explanation of how it's currently working and what needs to be fixed or improved:

### ✅ Current Functionality:

1. **Menu Display:**

   * A special menu item is displayed below the hero section on the main page.

2. **Admin Panel:**

   * There is an **"Admin Overview"** section.
   * There is a **"Today's Special"** tab with options to:

     * Choose an item.
     * Select start date.
     * Set discount.

3. **Workflow:**

   * When I click "Edit Today's Special," I can fill in the item, start date, and discount.
   * After clicking **"Update"**, it says **"Success"** — but the special menu item and the “Today’s Special” tab **do not reflect any changes**.

### ❌ Issues:

* In the **Admin Overview**, there's still an option to "edit" the special menu item — but it's not functional.
  👉 Please **remove this edit option** from Admin Overview since the “Today’s Special” tab already handles it.

* The **update process fails silently**. I checked the logs and found it's a **WebSocket issue**, likely because the site is deployed on **Replit**.

* The **statistics section** under “Today’s Special” is **static** — it's not updating.

### ✅ What I Need:

1. **Fix the Update Mechanism:**

   * Ensure the “Today’s Special” update works **regardless of where it's deployed** (Replit or elsewhere).
   * If WebSockets are unreliable on Replit, consider using **REST APIs** or **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** instead for reliability.

2. **Consistent Updates:**

   * When “Today’s Special” is updated, it should immediately reflect:

     * On the **menu (below hero section)**.
     * In the **Admin Panel’s "Today’s Special" tab**.

3. **Dynamic Stats:**

   * The statistics section under "Today's Special" should pull **real order data**.
   * It should show data **from the day the special item was activated** (e.g., number of times ordered, revenue generated, etc.).

Let me know if you need clarification on any part. Thanks!
